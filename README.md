# SafeStep - Warning System for the Blind 👟🔊

## Project Information
- **Project Name:** SafeStep  
- **Developers:** Fatemeh Vaghei, Mobina Amiri Notash  
- **University:** University of Tabriz  
- **Project Start Date:** March 25, 2025

## 🎯 Project Goal  
The goal of SafeStep is to design and implement a smart warning system for blind individuals,
which can be installed on shoes. The system uses advanced sensors to detect obstacles and holes in the path,
alerting the user through vibration or sound.

## 🔥 Features and Capabilities
✅ **Obstacle and Hole Detection:** Using ultrasonic and infrared sensors  
✅ **Tactile and Audio Alerts:** Warning through vibration motors and small speakers  
✅ **Energy Efficiency:** Use of lithium batteries for reduced weight and extended battery life  
✅ **Upgradeable:** Future addition of GPS and machine learning for improved functionality
